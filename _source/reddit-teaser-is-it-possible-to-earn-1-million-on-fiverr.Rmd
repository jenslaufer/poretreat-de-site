__Do you think it is possible to earn 1-million on Fiverr?__

We read the article  [How a dad made almost 1 million on Fiverr](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/24/how-this-dad-made-almost-1-million-on-fiverr.html?__source=msn%7Cmoney%7Cinline%7Cstory%7C&par=msn&doc=105300315) and were just as curious about the question as you are. 

First, we collected more articles about what people earn on Fiverr, then tried to prove how realistic a story like this is.

We collected real data for each of the sellers and calculated what they earned so far with their Gigs.


We found out this:

```{r}
example.top.seller.revenue.df %>% 
  mutate(est_revenue=round(total_reviewed_revenue/0.5,0)) %>%  
  select(real_name, est_revenue) %>% arrange(desc(est_revenue)) %>% kable(col.names = c('Seller','Estimated Revenue'))
```



We also found out that just one single Gig made one seller over 500k, which is unbelievable.
